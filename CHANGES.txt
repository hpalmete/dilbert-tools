     -o respectively in fetch

   o Specify collection path for update with --path=PATH option

     respectively in update

* 2008-07-12 (r20)
   o Uses dilbert.com/fast to find the strip URL; less bandwidth used
   o fetchStrip() changes modification time on DL'd strips to match the strip's
     date to help sorting by modification time

     that, remove that from the update script
